#The following code is designed to facilitate standardisation for distributed network analysis.
#A template is provided for ease of use, populated with the mid 2012 population estimates for the UK (Office of National Statistics)
#Enter your population's data into column 'popage2' of the file 'standardisation.csv', and move this to your working directory
#To check your working directory type getwd()
#To change the working directory type setwd(type path here...)
#e.g. setwd("c:/Users/mqbpjhr4/Documents")

#the events column should contain the number of AKIs occuring within each age range for each gender within the index year
#popage1 should be the number of people within standard population for each gender and age bracket
#popage2 should be the number of people within the test data population (not just those with observed events) for each gender and age bracket

as.numeric(c(data$events,data$popage)) #Make sure the continuous variables are seen as numeric by R
as.factor(c(data$age,data$gender)) #Assign age and gender as categorical factors

SR*10000 #The outcome is an age and gender standardised rate of AKI incidence per 10,000 people per annum. Change this figure if you wish to change the denominator.
